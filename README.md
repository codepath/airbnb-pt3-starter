# AirBnB Clone Part 2

For this lab, interns will be creating a clone of AirBnB - a modern booking platform for local bed and breakfasts. This competitor application will be geared towards celebrities only, in the hopes of attracing the highest revenue customers to the platform. Celebrities should be able to sign up, list any of their personal residences, and let other celebrities book trips to stay in their houses.

The focus of this lab will be on constructing a complete authentication suite that offers the ability for users to confirm the email addresses they signed up with and reset their password if they need to.
